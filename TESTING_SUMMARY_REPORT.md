## 🔧 Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Handler Constructor Requirements
**Issue**: AIHandler and MediaHandler required AppState parameter but tests weren't providing it.
**Fix**: Updated test scripts to create AppState instances and pass them to handlers.

### 2. I18N Method Names
**Issue**: Test was using incorrect method names (`get` instead of `t`, `set_language` instead of `switch`).
**Fix**: Updated tests to use correct I18N interface methods.

### 3. VideoHandler Error Handling
**Issue**: `get_video_info()` was returning error dictionaries instead of empty dictionaries for non-existent files.
**Fix**: Modified method to return empty dictionary for better error handling consistency.

### 4. MediaHandler Path Validation
**Issue**: `save_image()` wasn't properly handling invalid file paths on Windows.
**Fix**: Added proper path validation and error handling for invalid directory creation.

### 5. Import Name Mismatch
**Issue**: Test was trying to import `BaseWindow` but the actual class was named `BaseMainWindow`.
**Fix**: Updated import to use correct class name.

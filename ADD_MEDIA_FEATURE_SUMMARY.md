# Add Media Feature Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Overview
Successfully implemented the "Add Media" button in Step 2 of the gallery generation dialog, allowing users to manually add additional photos to their galleries after AI selection.

## âœ… What Was Implemented

### 1. **Add Media Button in Step 2**
- Located in the header of Step 2, positioned on the right side
- Green button with consistent styling matching the app's design
- Always visible when Step 2 is shown
- Opens the media selection dialog when clicked

### 2. **Enhanced Gallery Generation Workflow**
- **Step 1**: Optional AI prompt-based media selection
- **Step 2**: Review selected media + Add Media button for manual additions
- **Step 3**: Caption generation and final gallery creation

### 3. **Improved Click Handlers**
- Fixed lambda closure issue that prevented proper click handling
- All thumbnails (original AI-selected + manually added) are now clickable
- Click to remove functionality works for all media items
- Proper event handler creation using closure pattern

### 4. **Media Selection Dialog Integration**
- Excludes already selected media from the selection options
- Seamless addition of new media to existing gallery
- Real-time preview updates when new media is added
- Automatic Step 2 visibility when media is added directly

### 5. **User Experience Improvements**
- Step 1 is now truly optional - users can skip AI selection entirely
- Users can start with AI selection and then manually add more
- Mixed workflow: AI + manual selection in the same gallery
- Clear visual feedback with proper button states

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified:
